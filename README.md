# fifa-team-generator

> A fifa team generator build with NativeScript-Vue

## Usage

``` bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Build for production
yarn run build
yarn run build:<platform>

# Build, watch for changes and debug the application
yarn run debug
yarn run debug:<platform>

# Build, watch for changes and run the application
yarn run watch
yarn run watch:<platform>

# Clean the NativeScript application instance (i.e. rm -rf dist)
yarn run clean
```

> When invoking the various npm scripts, omitting the platform will attempt to launch `tns` for both platforms, which will only work in a properly configured OSX environment.
